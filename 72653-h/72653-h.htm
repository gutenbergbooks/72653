</div>

<p class="dropcap">After the applause won by Mr. Stephen Crane’s
<i>Red Badge of Courage</i>, a little reaction is not
strange; and this has already taken, in some quarters,
a form quite unjust and unfair. Certainly any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
one who spent so much as a week or two in camp,
thirty years ago, must be struck with the extraordinary
freshness and vigor of the book. No one except Tolstoi,
within my knowledge, has brought out the daily
life of war so well; it may be said of these sentences,
in Emerson’s phrase, “Cut these and they bleed.”
The breathlessness, the hurry, the confusion, the
seeming aimlessness, as of a whole family of disturbed
ants, running to and fro, yet somehow accomplishing
something at last; all these aspects,
which might seem the most elementary and the easiest
to depict, are yet those surest to be omitted, not
merely by the novelists, but by the regimental histories
themselves.</p>

<p>I know that when I first read Tolstoi’s <i>War and
Peace, The Cossacks and Sevastopol</i>, it seemed as if
all other so-called military novels must become at
once superannuated and go out of print. All others
assumed, in comparison, that bandbox aspect which
may be seen in most military or naval pictures; as in
the well known engraving of the death of Nelson,
where the hero is sinking on the deck in perfect
toilette, at the height of a bloody conflict, while
every soldier or sailor is grouped around him, each
in spotless garments and heroic attitude. It is this
Tolstoi quality—the real tumult and tatters of the
thing itself—which amazes the reader of Crane’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
novel. Moreover, Tolstoi had been through it all in
person; whereas this author is a youth of twenty-four,
it seems, born since the very last shot fired in
the Civil War. How did he hit upon his point of
view?</p>

<p>Yet this very point of view, strange to say, has
been called a defect. Remember that he is telling
the tale, not of a commanding general, but of a common
soldier—a pawn in the game; a man who sees
only what is going on immediately around him, and,
for the most part, has the key to nothing beyond.
This he himself knows well at the time. Afterward,
perhaps, when the affair is discussed at the campfire,
and his view compared with what others say, it begins
to take shape, often mixed with all sorts of errors;
and when it has reached the Grand Army Post
and been talked over afterward for thirty years, the
narrator has not a doubt of it all. It is now a perfectly
ordered affair, a neat and well arranged game
of chess, often with himself as a leading figure.
That is the result of too much perspective. The
wonder is that this young writer, who had no way of
getting at it all except the gossip—printed or written—of
these very old soldiers, should be able to go
behind them all, and give an account of their life,
not only more vivid than they themselves have ever
given, but more accurate. It really seems a touch of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
that marvelous intuitive quality which for want of a
better name we call genius.</p>

<p>Now is it a correct criticism of the book to complain,
as one writer has done, that it does not dwell
studiously on the higher aspects of the war? Let
the picture only be well drawn, and the moral will
take care of itself; never fear. The book is not a
patriotic tract, but a delineation; a cross section of
the daily existence of the raw enlisted-man. In
other respects it is reticent, because it is truthful.
Does any one suppose that in the daily routine of the
camp there was room for much fine talk about motives
and results—that men were constantly appealing,
like Carlyle’s Frenchman, “to posterity and the
immortal Gods?” Fortunately or unfortunately, the
Anglo Saxon is not built that way; he errs on the
other side; habitually understates instead of overstating
his emotions; and while he is making the
most heroic sacrifices of his life, usually prefers to
scold about rations or grumble at orders. He is to
be judged by results; not by what he says, which is
often ungracious and unornamental, but by what he
does.</p>

<p>The very merit of this book is that in dealing with
his men the author offers, within this general range,
all the essential types of character—the man who
boasts and the man who is humble—the man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
thinks he may be frightened and is not, and the man
who does not expect to be, but is. For his main
character he selects a type to be found in every regiment—the
young man who does not know himself,
who first stumbles into cowardice, to his own amazement,
and then is equally amazed at stumbling into
courage; who begins with skulking, and ends by
taking a flag. In Doyle’s <i>Micah Clarke</i> the old
Roundhead soldier tells his grandchildren how he
felt inclined to bob his head when he first heard bullets
whistle, and adds “If any soldier ever told you
that he did not, the first time that he was under fire,
then that soldier is not a man to trust.” This is putting
it too strongly, for some men are born more
stolid, other more nervous; but the nervous man
is quite as likely to have the firmer grain, and to
come out the more heroic in the end. In my own
limited experience, the only young officer whom I
ever saw thoroughly and confessedly frightened,
when first under fire, was the only one of his regiment
who afterwards chose the regular army for his
profession, and fought Indians for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>As for <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>, the test of the
book is in the way it holds you. I only know that
whenever I take it up I find myself reading it over
and over, as I do Tolstoi’s <i>Cossacks</i>, and find it as
hard to put down. None of Doyle’s or Weyman’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
books bear re-reading, in the same way; you must
wait till you have forgotten their plots. Even the slipshod
grammar seems a part of the breathless life and
action. How much promise it gives, it is hard to say.
Goethe says that as soon as a man has done one good
thing, the world conspires against him to keep him
from doing another. Mr. Crane has done one good
thing, not to say two; but the conspiracy of admiration
may yet be too much for him. It is earnestly to be
hoped, at least, that he may have the wisdom to stay
in his own country and resist the temptation to test
his newly-found English reputation by migrating—an
experiment by which Bret Harte has been visibly
dwarfed and Henry James hopelessly diluted.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The new assistant sat in the office, vainly endeavoring
to discourage the perspiration in its
efforts to show him how the water comes down at
Lodore. But, with a perseverance worthy a wetter
cause than the dry weather, it continued to flow
from his mobile brow and neck, mop he never so
well. The thermometer on the wall registered 89,
and the calendar only May 1st. It was the new assistant’s
first day in the office, and he had already
begun to contemplate with humid horror the prospect
of spending an entire summer in a place that
was already warm enough to have caused his once
stiff and glossy collar to emulate his puff-bosom shirt.</p>

<p>“Why,” he gasped to the Old Book-keeper,
“what <i>will</i> it be when summer really comes?”</p>

<p>The latter, who had been a cent short in his cash
the night before, gruffly replied that it would probably
be June 1st. But, before the day was over, he,
too, was forced to realize the heat and to speak of it.
So, when his face began to assume the appearance of
a greasy plank under a hydrant, he concluded that it
might not be so great a compromise to his dignity for
him to agree with his junior, and his looks showed
him to be rapidly thawing. They managed to survive
that day and the next and several others that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
followed. In the meantime the thermometer seemed
bent, in fact, warped, upon beating all previous records,
and the two sufferers watched the mercury
climb, until it seemed to be trying to reach its Olympian
namesake. The thought that the worst was to
come served to increase their distress. It always
does.</p>

<p>Finally, the Old Book-keeper, who occupied a
sort of oldest inhabitant position in the neighborhood,
although he had always worked for a living, threw
up the sponge and reluctantly admitted that, for so
early in the season, it really beat all the weather he
ever saw. The new assistant sympathized with the
old man in his defeat, and went so far in his efforts
to cheer him, as across the street to buy the beer,
without first proposing to match for it.</p>

<p>So affairs went on, nothing worthy of note transpiring,
except, of course, the two now becoming
warm friends. Every morning and again after lunch
they would enter the office, take off their coats and
everything else that Mr. Comstock might not object
to, and drearily settle down to their work, always
wondering if they would be able to stand it when
summer really came. By this time, they had ceased
to consult the thermometer, and the calendar was
forgotten. Several pages that should have been
torn from the latter remained there still: not enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
air was stirring to move them. At last, one afternoon
just as the new assistant had succeeded
in opening his attenuated countenance wide enough
to say, as usual—“I wonder what it will be when
summer really”—the door was suddenly darkened
by a portly form enveloped in a heavy overcoat
and a confident manner that unmistakably stamped
their wearer as the Boss, and a hearty voice exclaimed—“Well,
this bracing weather is delightful
after a hot summer on the Riviera!” The Old
Book-keeper and the new assistant staggered to the
door and looked out. The snow was falling thick
and fast.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Having finished some literature I put it into an
envelope, with postage stamps to get it back;
for that happened sometimes, even when it was real,
hand-made literature, as in this case. It came back,
because the editor of the <i>Bugle</i> said it was too long.
I sat up that night paring and changing, and when it
had been condensed a third it occurred to me that
maybe there was a surer market for it in the office of
the <i>Banner of Freedom</i>. Another try; more postage
stamps. Returned with statement that “We never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
print stories less than 6,000 words long and yours is
too short.” I rewrote it in part, restoring an episode
on which I had slightly prided myself in the original
version, and as it was neither long nor short I sent
it, this time to <i>Tomlinson’s Bi-Monthly</i>. Tomlinson
kept it for nearly two years before returning it, and
it reached me a veritable tramp of a manuscript,
dusty, creased, dog-eared and ragged, with editorial
changes in blue pencil that could not be erased,
and the remark that, as <i>Tomlinson’s</i> circulated
largely among the Bulgarians in America, and received
advertising patronage from them, it was impossible
to print anything that might offend Bulgarians.
This surprised me, because the fact that
one of my characters, Gilhooly McManus, was a
Bulgarian had nearly escaped my notice. He was
introduced because his nationality made occasion for
an incident that I needed, and had he been an
American every reader would have denounced his
conduct as absurd.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to copy it afresh and
send it to <i>Bloxam’s</i>. It was returned in the next
mail, manifestly unread, with the usual form announcement
that “owing to pressure” etc., it was
impossible, etc., so I tried <i>The Pacific</i> with it next.
It came back in time with the objection that it was
too sensational, and the next week it was returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
by the <i>Chambermaid’s Own</i> as too quiet. <i>Hanks’
Review</i> would not have it because plots were going
out of fashion, and <i>The Athenian</i> suggested that I
imbue it with at least a trace of interest. At last a
little one-horse magazine in Texas offered to print it
if I would subscribe for three years to his magazine
at two dollars per year. I accepted the offer by
return mail, stipulating only that the magazine should
be sent, with my compliments, to an almshouse.</p>

<p>And I set out on my next story wondering if the
time would ever come when a man could speak his
mind to his fellow men in print, or if all written
things would have to be shaped according to the
Procrustean notions of the average editor.</p>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-c.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Clangingharp told Frostembight the only
prophetic way to write an epic was to save all
the rough drafts, with interlinear corrections. He
said your biographer could thus trace the growth of
your work from its earliest inception to its final
bloom, and the photographic reproductions would do
away with the cost of sketches. Frostembight said
a man that would write an epic was a lunk-head.
Clangingharp started to get up and destroy Frostembight,
but he stepped on Marcus Aurelius, and with
a rush of words to the throat fell helpless into his
chair. Marcus Aurelius was the cat. “Dam that
cat,” added Clangingharp.</p>

<p>One night when Clangingharp sat writing, an episode
occurred. Clangingharp couldn’t write on an
empty stomach, and the verses he made when he
was sober were so drab and elegiac that in spite of
his remark to Frostembight he threw them away and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
went out after cocktails. He could write shriller
and hotter stuff when he had had cocktails. Well,
one night he sat thinking of what an empty thing a
cocktail is. He had been writing verses, and he
knew they were regrettable. But he did not go out
and have cocktails. It might be told why he didn’t,
but what’s the use? You go to a comedy to get
away from your business troubles, and the chief
clown constantly thrusts under your nose a big wad
of stage money. It would simply be dragging in
sordid matter that should have no place in a psychological
study. It is enough to say he didn’t go out.
He sat and plunked drops of purple ink from his
pen into a blotter with an insurance advertisement on
it that lay submissively on the desk. Then Marcus
Aurelius leaped onto the blotter, and a fiendish shine
glittered dryly in the epicist’s eye. He noticed the
cat was white. Rainy afternoons on the fire-escape
had made the beast very white. Clangingharp
plunked a drop of royal purple on the tip of Marcus
Aurelius’s tail.</p>

<p>The next instant Clangingharp had written:</p>

<p>“And gave him hemorrhage of the soul.”</p>

<p>“Great!” he screeched in a seething cauldron of
joy. “Powerful!”</p>

<p>He began to wonder whether or not cattails were
as effective as cocktails. He plunked another royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
purple drop onto the cat’s tail, and wrote another
line. It was not so good as hemorrhage of the soul,
but it was pretty fair:</p>

<p>“And freshet-flushed his hydrant eye.”</p>

<p>For two weeks Clangingharp’s days and nights
were dry. He did not go out after cocktails, and as
there was a drought on the fire-escape the cat was
becoming splendidly regal. The window was kept
open, for the weather was hot; but Marcus Aurelius
got no nourishment excepting an occasional mouse
and what he absorbed from the ink, so he staid in.
Clangingharp would sit there for hours and deliberately
sling ink at him. Not a growl from Marcus.
At last he would take down the folding-bed, and before
getting in would remember the pen and wipe it
along Marcus’s spine. Not a plaint from the cat:
always patient and forgiving.</p>

<p>The epic was growing. It had become so vast
now that Clangingharp had long since stopped saving
rough drafts, and the complete copy was piled up
neatly on his desk. There was so much that he had
even ceased reading the whole of it through after
writing each new line. The evening came when
Clangingharp felt that he could finish the last canto.
His heroine was about to get her document so she
could be married to the hero, and Clangingharp felt
that without stimulants he was scarcely up to writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the heroine’s final spasm to the jury. It may as well
be said here that Clangingharp had been hearing
from home lately, so he decided to go out and have
them for a last strain. He piled his manuscript
fondly on a corner of the desk, dipped his pen
thoughtfully into the ink-well, and gazing abstractedly
at Marcus, plunked the whole penful into a
mute Aurelian eye.</p>

<p>When Clangingharp got back he had had several
of them, so at first he did not quite take in what had
happened. It seemed to him as if much greater
cohesion and consistency had been imparted to the
epic by the insertion interlinearly as well as between
the pages, of his pot of mucilage. Illustrations had
also been sketched over the sheets with the unbridled
ink-bottle. The work as a whole had begun to circulate,
and was already widespread in its influence.
Much of it looked as if the critics had already been
at it. Clangingharp stepped to the window and
looked out. Golden light from the window in a
first-floor flat shone brightly over the bottom of the
air-shaft. There, curled up on the cement, lay Marcus
Aurelius, a study in purple and dead.</p>

<p>“Dam that cat!” said Clangingharp.</p>

</div>

<h3>QUERY ONE.</h3>

<p>Whom do you consider the greatest living <i>litterateur</i>?</p>

<p>Formerly, this matter was in doubt; but there can
be no dispute over this point in recent years. But,
unfortunately, both good taste and modesty prevent
me from making a more definite reply.</p>

<h3>QUERY TWO.</h3>

<p>I notice you frequently refer to Henry Ward
Beecher as a great man; will you kindly state why
you consider him such?</p>

<p>Mr. Beecher acquired some reputation in Brooklyn
a few years ago as a preacher; this contributed
somewhat to his fame. His principal claim to greatness,
however, rests on his wonderful power of recognizing
genius in others. He early saw the advantage
of seeking out and connecting himself with the
great geniuses of his neighborhood. I need scarcely
add that I was raised in Brooklyn, and that he was
among my first admirers.</p>

<h3>QUERY THREE.</h3>

<p>Should a young man smoke cigarettes?</p>

<p>I notice on glancing over our advertisement columns,
that the cigarette trust has given up its devilish
attempt to make our American women nicotine <i>habitues</i>,
so I will divert from my usual plan of never referring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
to myself, and tell you my own experience as
a reply to this question.</p>

<p>Ten years ago this very day, a large cigarette firm
in New York City offered me ten thousand dollars a
year if I would smoke their brand of these death-dealing
instruments of the evil one. I was very
very young at the time; this is my explanation of my
only great temptation. I confess that I did not see
the horror, the degradation in this suggestion; I saw
only in the offer the gold. I am changed now, but,
then, it was a fierce battle. But my mother plead
with me, and she made me promise never even to
think of such a wicked thing again. See the result.
I now edit the largest journal in the world, and am
educating the women of America what to do and
how to do it. This lesson teaches you to do always
as your mother tells you. Some day you may edit
the <i>Homely Ladies’ Journal</i>, and then you can catch
the sympathies of your readers with this sentiment,
without fear of your conscience keeping you awake at
nights.</p>

<h3>QUERY FOUR.</h3>

<p>Which of our great poets do you consider led the
happiest lives?</p>

<p>Whittier and Tennyson, because they were so
blessed with great friendships. I knew them both
well myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>I shall never forget that glorious day in London,
when Tennyson told me, with tears in his eyes, that
his only regret was that he had written himself out
before I had taken charge of the <i>Homely Ladies’
Journal</i>; while Whittier, the dear old chap, told
me his fiery war songs that brought him social ostracism,
need never have been written had I edited the
<i>Woman’s House Journal</i> during that period.</p>

<h3>QUERY FIVE.</h3>

<p>Do you find editing such a great journal as the
<i>Woman’s House Journal</i> hard work? It must be,
for I find it very hard to edit properly my own little
country weekly.</p>

<p>This question it is almost impossible to answer;
to you my work would seem Herculean, unceasing,
impossible; but to me it is so different that I feel that
I cannot answer this question to make myself intelligible.
This question is doubly difficult to answer,
for I have systematized my work by establishing a
drag net for getting material. I will explain my
method. I take up the latest magazine; I see a
story by some new great writer, a society leader in
the metropolis. Presto! I order a series of articles
on “How Women Should Behave at Teas” from
her pen. I hear that a great English novelist is coming
over to seek the American dollar; again, as with
lightning, I order an article “How Your Women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Impress Me.” It is immaterial to me what they actually
do write, or how far they wander from their
text, so long as they use my ready made titles. They
look so nice in the index.</p>

<p>In this way, I use the small talk of the writers as a
soft food for my readers. Just as you attempt, in
your feeble way, to serve up the gossip of your little
hamlet in your weekly paper, so I do; for I tell you
in confidence what women want is not literature, not
art, not science, but gossip. So I make all the great
writers of the day write gossip for them. This is the
secret of my success. You should feel very happy
now, for, although my thoughts and pen fly with
lightninglike rapidity, I have spent five hundred dollars’
worth of time in answering your inquiry.</p>

<p>I will answer the rest of my anxious readers as
soon as I can systematize other incidents in my very
short but successward career. In the meantime,
young men by following the lines laid down in this
paper cannot fail of success, real, pure, noble success.</p>

<h3>UNFORBIDDEN FRUIT.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I have a plot:—A man and a girl in a boarding
house in Duesseldorf were rather sweet on each
other. It might have become love and a marriage,
since they were the only Americans there, were both
to stay all summer, and both attractive.</p>

<p>The romance began well, they even got so far that
one day he held her hand and leaned forward, gazing
deeply into her eyes.</p>

<p>Just then the Frau Professorin who kept the <i>pension</i>
stepped suddenly into the parlor, saw them, and
retreated precipitately.</p>

<p>Here was a catastrophe. Her reputation according
to German ideas, gone. “Ein junges Maedchen
sich se zu eenehmen—abschenlich!” Nothing but
an engagement could excuse the holding of the hand
of a junges Maedchen by a man.</p>

<p>They looked at each other and laughed, ruefully.
Then they agreed to become engaged, temporarily:
what in Virginia is known as “just engaged,” in
contradistinction to “engaged to be married.”</p>

<p>For a time it was good fun. He was more devoted
than ever; and they even thought of making it permanent.
But you know how people act in Germany.
Every time he came into the parlor, whoever was sitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
beside her, jumped up, and he had to go over
and sit beside her. Then he had to make pretty
speeches to her while all the other boarders, with
German tact, stopped talking and listened.</p>

<p>The man and the girl carried out their roles well,
though they drew the line at having their picture
taken with their arms around each other. This was
a great disappointment to the other boarders.
Neither the man nor the girl was able to talk to any
one in the house except about the girl and the man.
It got to be boresome after a while.</p>

<p>When at last they left Duesseldorf, the joy with
which they flew asunder was something to see.
There my plot and the romance end. Of course
there were to be chaperones and scenery.</p>

<h3>WHICH SINNED?</h3>

<p>I was confessor; my cousin or Miss Hart was sinner
(each has confessed on the other); the story is
about this:—</p>

<p>He stood opposite her in the waltz quadrille. He
did not know her, but thought what a pretty girl that
was in the pink dress, and wondered if I knew her.
(I was in one of the side couples.)</p>

<p>At “Ladies half change,” he reached out his hand
with eagerness and she gave hers without reluctance.
When they stood in their places again, he continued
to hold hers, instead of dropping it as he might.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
(This may have been absent-mindedness.) Presently
she turned to him, smiling, and glanced down
at their hands. He smiled, too. Then she withdrew
her hand, but without apparent offense.</p>

<p>Just then the order came, “Forward and back.”
He reached out his hand for hers, saying, <i>sotto voce</i>,
“You see, you might as well have let me keep it.”</p>

<p>This was all the preliminary skirmishing. The
question of veracity comes next.</p>

<p>After the dance my cousin came to me.</p>

<p>“Who was that pretty girl opposite me?” He
said.</p>

<p>“What girl?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The one in pink: who was to your right: and
danced with the man in the wilted collar.”</p>

<p>“Ah! That was Miss Hart. Nice girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented my cousin. “She squeezed my
hand the second time we met in the grand right and
left. I wish you’d introduce me to her.”</p>

<p>The next dance happened to be the second extra,
which I had with Miss Hart. We had not gone
half way around the room when she said:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you introduce your cousin to me?
He squeezed my hand in the last quadrille.”</p>

<p>Of course it’s a simple matter of tact. I have my
own opinion, but prefer to allow the sentimental
reader to judge for himself. I have known Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Hart a long time and she never has squeezed my—however
I don’t suppose that really bears on the
point.</p>

<h3>THE UNUSABLE PLOT.</h3>

<p>Here is another plot, but unfortunately it belongs
to a friend of mine, so that I cannot use it.</p>

<p>If is half past four in Paris—stories of this class
are always put in Paris—and the hero, who is also
the villain, goes into a church. He stops at one of
the chapels and looks in. A woman is there, but the
light is dim and he cannot at first be sure that it is
she whom he seeks, women’s backs being all somewhat
alike.</p>

<p>She is kneeling, and she has been crying, though
the hero cannot see that. He speaks to her and
thanks her for giving him this opportunity of seeing
her, and is going to take her hand; but she interrupts
him and tells him that it is all a terrible mistake, that
she cares for him to be sure, but that it is in a platonic
way as a brother, that she truly loves her husband,
and is sorry for all that has happened.</p>

<p>The hero who is also a villain listens with half a
smile: he has seen women repent before, and it adds
zest to the chase. His manner warms and he makes
love admirably.</p>

<p>The heroine is nice—so the person who made this
plot told me—and the hero is horrid. His hair is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
little thin on the top of his head, and his boots are
carefully polished, and he is a little fat. He is always
polite to a pretty woman, but his politeness is
something of an insult.</p>

<p>It is because the heroine is really nice, I suppose,
that she at last persuades him that she does love her
husband and not him. Then he goes away, and she,
sinking down on the <i>priedieu</i>, listens to the click of
his polished heels on the marble floor of the church.
She sees at her feet the flowers which he had worn
in his button-hole, and she picks them up and kisses
them passionately. She is going to hide them in her
bosom: but then being really nice she lays them before
the figure of the Virgin, with a little prayer and
then goes away.</p>

<p>As for the hero who is also the villain, he is piqued
that it should be she that has stopped loving first;
but is perhaps as well, he reflects, for she was beginning
to bore him.</p>

<p>He looks at his watch and jumps into a cab. The
horse goes fast, for the hero has an engagement at
half-past five o’clock with Therese and has offered
the cabman fifty centimes <i>pour-boire</i> if he will get to
her house on time.</p>

<p>I have another plot, but I do not expect ever to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
anything with it. It is about the Man in the Iron
Mask. Somebody is to be handling the iron mask—it
is kept, I think, in the Invalides at Paris—when
upon pressing a certain knob a hidden recess is to be
revealed, constructed with marvelous ingenuity (as
they always are you know) wherein is to be a paper
telling all about the man in the iron mask.</p>

<p>There is nothing very original so far; but as I
recollect this plot—I thought of it four years ago—the
denouement was very striking. Unfortunately I
have forgotten it.</p>

inhabitants, one-half of whom can neither read
nor write. Able-bodied men can be hired for forty
cents a day, and women who get a dollar a week and
board are very fortunate. The city of Cork has no
street cars, nor electric lights; the best hotel has no
elevator, nor gas; so you can neither fall down the
shaft nor asphixiate. At bed-time you are given a
candle which is duly charged in your bill. Three-fifths
of the citizens are Catholics and yet the city of
Cork boasts the finest Protestant Episcopal church of
its size in the United Kingdom. I refer to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Church of St. Fin Barre. It cost seven hundred and
fifty thousand dollars. The bronze gates that separate
the chancel from the nave, alone cost twenty
thousand dollars; sixteen thousand dollars were
paid for one window, and the grill-work, hand carved,
in the choir, took two men five years to make.
The building of this beautiful temple was made
possible only through the generosity of one Mr.
Guinness, manufacturer of a certain “stout” that is
known as “XXX.” This mixture is highly recommended
for nursing mothers and those in need of a
tonic.</p>

<p>And now a resident of Chicago proposes to
build in the Windy City a church patterned after the
beautiful church at Cork, but whose steeple is to be
twice as high, and which is to cost a full million dollars.
Cork can keep her rags and illiteracy; she may
continue sending her guests to bed with a candle; but
no longer shall she be able to boast her supremacy
in things ecclesiastic—not by a dam sight!</p>

Gods in one of the Buffalo (N. Y.) newspapers. In
his “Philistine Talk” he cites certain authors who
he claims have an itch for fame; and for their benefit
and the benefit of Organized Charity he gives the
following Fable:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Emperor Claudius on going up the steps of
the Capitol at Washington one day found a Beggar
who had a bad case of Eczema. Now the Eczema
had staked off its claim on that particular spot on the
Beggar’s back where he could not scratch it. The
Emperor being a tenderhearted man, and a generous,
acceded to the fellow’s prayer and ordered a
slave to scratch the Beggar’s back. Next morning
on mounting the Capitol steps the Emperor found
two Beggars in place of one. But instead of assigning
two slaves to scratch the backs of the two
Beggars, he remarked in a sweet imperial falsetto:
“Here you shabby sons of guns! scratch each
other!!” and passed on in maiden meditation fancy
free.</p>

arises from the agents of Mr. Howells having bought

both, I cannot say.</p>

<p>The papers below specified were, with the exception
of that contributed by the editor, Mr. Hubbard,

is now nearly half a century since this series (which

feel that no apology is needed in presenting

such distinctive biographical interest and literary value.</p>

<p class="larger noindent">The ROYCROFT Printing Shop
has in preparation GLYNNE’S
WIFE, a story in verse by Mrs.
Julia Ditto Young.</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Young is a Poet who has written much but
published little. This, her latest and believed by her
friends to be her best work, is the product of a mind
and heart singularly gifted by Nature, and ripened by
a long apprenticeship to Art. As a specimen of the
pure “lyric cry,” illustrating the melody possible in
the English tongue, the volume seems to stand alone
among all books written by modern versifiers. The
delicacy of touch, the faultless rhythm, the splendid
vocabulary and the gentle tho’ sure insight into the
human heart, make a combination of qualities very,
very seldom seen. The author <i>knows</i>, and knowing
blames not: a sustained sympathy being the keynote
of it all.</p>

<p>The publishers have endeavored to give the story
a typographical setting in keeping with the richness
of the lines. Five hundred and ninety copies are
being printed on smooth Holland hand-made paper,
and twenty-five on Tokio Vellum. The copies on
Holland paper will be bound in boards covered with
antique watered silk; the Vellum copies are bound
in like manner save that each will bear on the cover
a special water-color design done by the hand of the
author.</p>

<p>The price of the five hundred and ninety copies is
two dollars each; the Vellum copies five dollars
each. Every copy will be numbered and signed by
Mrs. Young. Orders are now being recorded and
will be delivered on September 1st, numbered in the
order received.</p>
